# Specular Map generator plugin for godot. 

*Note: this is a work in progress. Many improvements are needed. For better specular maps generation, please use [Laigter](https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter). Its also free and opens source.* \\

*Note 2: for better preview, you should also add normal map. You can generate it with [Laigter](https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter), or with the [Normal Map Dock for Godot](https://github.com/azagaya/godot_normalMap_generator)*

This plugin creates a dock that lets you open a texture and create a specular map for it adjusting a few controls. The specular map is exported in the same directory than the original texture, with a "*_s.png" prefix.
